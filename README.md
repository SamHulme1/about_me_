# About_me_ 

About me is a mini project, about me. Showcasing some of the projects i've previously worked on and am working on. It also features some information about who I am and what kind of skills and experiences I have. The website was build using Hubspots [base web app](https://github.com/HubSpot/BaseWebApp) on Github and deployed on Heroku. 
The website features bootstrap responsiveness, intergrated Hubspot Web Analytics and animations from the animate on scroll libary. 
The aims for this site were to try out new technologies and to create a user friendly web app to showcase the projects I've worked on so far.

## testing and validaion

all website links have been tested accross the site, responsiveness for different screen sizes has been tested using google development tools. The site has been optimised using Lighthouse. All code written by me has been validated using online validators: Jstint, nu-html validator and W3C-CSS validator. All written and visual information on the site came from me the developer.
