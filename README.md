# About_me_ 

About me is a mini project, about me. Showcasing some of the projects I've previously worked on and am working on. It also features some information about who I am and what kind of skills and experiences I have. The website was built using Hubspots [base web app](https://github.com/HubSpot/BaseWebApp) on Github and deployed on Heroku. 
The website features bootstrap responsiveness, integrated Hubspot Web Analytics and animations from the animate on scroll library. 
The aims for this site were to try out new technologies and to create a user-friendly web app to showcase the projects I've worked on so far.

## Testing and validation

![lighthouse-score](/project/images/lighthouse-performance.jpg)

all website links have been tested across the site, and responsiveness for different screen sizes has been tested using Google development tools. The site has been optimised using Lighthouse. All code written by me has been validated using online validators: Jstint, nu-html validator and W3C-CSS validator. All written and visual information on the site came from me the developer. 

## Compatability 

The site has been tested on Chrome and Safari
